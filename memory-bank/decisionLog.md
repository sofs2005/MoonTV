## Decision

*   Initialized the Memory Bank for the MoonTV project.

## Rationale

*   To maintain project context, facilitate collaboration between different modes, and provide a structured way to track progress, decisions, and architectural patterns.

## Implementation Details

*   Created the core Memory Bank files: `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`, and `systemPatterns.md`.
*   Populated `productContext.md` with information extracted from `README.md`.
